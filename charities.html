    <p class="section-text">
      A curated list of free and discounted technology programmes for UK charities,
      non-profits and social impact projects. You can point your own charity or
      partner organisations to these providers to reduce their running costs.
    </p>
    <p class="section-text">
      Each row shows a provider, what they offer, who typically qualifies,
      and how to apply. Always check the provider's current terms and eligibility
      before relying on an offer — programmes and limits can change.

  <p class="section-text">
    Sign in to use the cost calculator and site builder bundles. They sit behind the
    login wall so you can explore funding-sensitive budgets and publish service pages
    without exposing drafts publicly.
  </p>

  <p class="section-text">
    You can use either the backed-up folders or the dashboard-hosted versions. The
    hosted versions are better because they keep permissions, draft states, and publish
    controls together for your team.

  <p class="section-text">
    Use the calculator folder to model total cost of ownership for grants or trustee
    packs, then move into the site builder and nearby discovery flows to share offers
    with beneficiaries.
  </p>

  <p class="section-text">
    Suggested order: build budgets first with the calculator, then ship pages via the
    builder so you avoid version drift. Keeping everything in the dashboard also limits
    exposure of pre-public charity content.
