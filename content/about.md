  <p class="section-text">
    I'm Dave, living with multiple sclerosis and building byAIm as a charitable-first
    way to use AI, automation, and thoughtful IT to reduce workload therefore cost for people and
    organisations who need to maitain cost. Your donations to MS and neuro charities
    are the currency for the help I provide.
  </p>
  <p class="section-text">
    I focus on practical, lightweight changes: voice-friendly setups, gentle automations,
    clearer workflows, and realistic cloud choices that respect limited knowleddge time.
    Whether you're an individual business, a small charity, or a team, the goal is the same:
    tech that quietly supports you instead of draining you.
